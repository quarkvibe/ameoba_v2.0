# 🦠 Amoeba Vision

**AI content generation platform with built-in AI assistant.**

---

## 🎯 What Amoeba Is

### Simple Definition
An AI platform that generates content, delivers it via multiple channels, and can be extended by asking the AI to add features.

### Core Purpose
1. **Generate** content with AI (OpenAI, Anthropic, Ollama)
2. **Fetch** data from sources (RSS, APIs, websites)
3. **Deliver** via email, SMS, voice, webhooks, social media
4. **Automate** with scheduling (cron)
5. **Review** before delivery (optional human approval)
6. **Control** via SMS, dashboard, CLI, or API

### The Unique Feature
**Built-in AI assistant** that can extend Amoeba itself (with your approval).

```
User: "Add Discord integration"
AI Assistant: Generates code, shows diff, waits for approval
User: Approves
AI Assistant: Applied! Discord integration ready.
```

Like having **Cursor/Claude Code built into your platform**.
